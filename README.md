# Efficient K-Means Image Segmentation

In this project, conventional k-means clustering algorithm is implemented for both gray-scale and colored image segmentation.

The K-means algorithm is an unsupervised clustering method which classifies input data points into multiple classes based on their inherent distance from each other. It assumes that the data features form a vector space and attempts to find natural clustering within them.

The
